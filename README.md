## Meetup
* Adopt markdown (it will then be more handy to edit a meetup's description)
* Mail scheduling (for organizers)
* Drag 'n drop functionality for rearranging sponsors ordering (it isn't handy anymore if your group has lots of sponsors)
* As an organizer, I would like to be able to announce a meetup for which I have changed the date. Example: weather conditions might not allow us at some point to have a meetup, but instead of cancelling the meetup, I would like to just edit/empty its date and be able to reannounce it. Currently, such a feature is not available. Yo ucan only edit the meetup's date, but not able to announce the meetup again.
